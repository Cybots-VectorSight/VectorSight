ELEMENTS: 2 paths | CANVAS: 24×24 | TYPE: stroke-based

SPATIAL INTERPRETATION:
  LAYOUT SUMMARY: symmetric composition (strong bilateral)
  Composition: simple icon
  Orientation: strong bilateral symmetry; strong vertical symmetry (1.00)
  Silhouette: sparse, open composition; widest at top; roughly square proportions; upward protrusion from center; extends down on center; narrowest at row 31% (width drops to 10% vs 26% above/below) — distinct upper and lower mass regions; empty: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right; principal axis: horizontal (18°, eccentricity=0.08); highly concave silhouette (hull fill=27%)
  Skeleton: closed loop (97px), no branching
  Radial profile (0°=right, CCW, 15°): 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4
  No significant peaks or valleys (approximately circular)
  Simplified outline (10 vertices): M 4,14 L 3,14 L 4,10 L 2,8 L 4,5 L 9,4 L 8,6 L 3,7 L 3,9 L 5,10 Z
  Mass distribution: evenly distributed; vertically centered; quadrants: upper-left=14%, upper-right=14%, lower-left=14%, lower-right=15%; vertical thirds: top=27%, mid=40%, bottom=33%
  Focal elements:
    - Concentric group [E1, E2] at (12,12) [mid-center], 2 layers, max circularity=1.00, tiers=MEDIUM/MEDIUM, root-level (independent, drawn on top)
  Reading hints:
    - High symmetry (1.00) — balanced/symmetric design or front-facing orientation.

SHAPE NARRATIVE:
  Contour: Starting from bottom-center: rises up at left, rises short up at upper-left (narrow peak), extends right at upper-left, rises short up at top (broad curved lobe), extends left at top, descends short lower-left at upper-left (narrow peak), descends short lower-right at upper-left, descends short down at left (broad curved lobe), extends right at lower-left (broad curved lobe).
  Structural detail:
    - E1: highly curved, complex boundary (33 inflections)
    - E2: highly curved

CONCENTRIC GROUPS:
  [E1, E2] at center (12,12)

KEY OVERLAPS:
  E1↔E2 (IoU=0.100)

LEARNED PATTERNS:
  1. Low fill percentage with many elements means stroke-based or outline-only rendering. The shapes exist as boundaries, not as filled regions. The visual result may appear solid to a viewer but the SVG construction uses outlines. Don't confuse SVG rendering technique with visual appearance.
  2. High bilateral symmetry with few elements indicates intentional geometric construction — likely a designed symbol, icon, or simple illustration. The symmetry axis and paired elements define the compositional structure directly.
  3. Concentric groups (elements sharing a center) are multi-ring constructions — a detail feature built from layered shapes. Their position relative to the largest containing element and their size tier determine their structural role.
  4. Read the positive space grid as a low-resolution thumbnail. Trace the boundary between X and dot — that is the silhouette outline. Curved non-rectangular boundaries indicate non-geometric construction. The grid shape is often more informative than individual element properties.
  5. Elements at 0px distance are touching or overlapping — they form continuous visual surfaces. This construction uses stacked shapes for shading, gradient simulation, or color regions rather than discrete separate parts. Read the stacking tree to see layering order.
