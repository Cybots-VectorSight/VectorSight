=== VECTORSIGHT ENRICHMENT ===

ELEMENTS: 4 paths | CANVAS: 24×24 | TYPE: stroke-based

SPATIAL INTERPRETATION:
  LAYOUT SUMMARY: symmetric composition (strong bilateral)
  Composition: simple icon
  Orientation: strong bilateral symmetry; strong vertical symmetry (1.00)
  Silhouette: sparse, open composition; widest at top; roughly square proportions; upward protrusion from center; extends down on center; narrowest at row 47% (width drops to 6% vs 21% above/below) — distinct upper and lower mass regions; empty: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right; principal axis: horizontal (3°, eccentricity=0.03); highly concave silhouette (hull fill=21%)
  Skeleton: main down axis (4px). with 3 branches — right (3px, upper-left), right (3px, lower-left), right (3px, lower-right). 0 junctions, 6 endpoints
  Radial profile (0°=right, CCW, 15°): 14,7,8,8,13,13,13,13,13,8,8,7,13,13,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,13
  Peaks: 0° (14px, right, narrow spike ~30° wide). Valleys: 15° (7px, right), 165° (7px, left)
  Simplified outline (5 vertices): M 8,10 L 6,10 L 7,7 L 8,7 L 9,9 Z
  Shape topology: body mass with 1 narrow spike (right)
  Mass distribution: evenly distributed; vertically centered; quadrants: upper-left=12%, upper-right=12%, lower-left=11%, lower-right=11%; vertical thirds: top=25%, mid=40%, bottom=35%
  Focal elements:
    - E3: circular (circular, circ=1.00) inside E2
    - E4: circular (circular, circ=1.00) inside E2
  Reading hints:
    - High symmetry (1.00) — balanced/symmetric design or front-facing orientation.
    - 3 circular elements.

SHAPE NARRATIVE:
  Contour: Starting from bottom-center: rises upper-right at upper (broad curved lobe), rises short upper-left at upper, extends left at upper (broad curved lobe), descends short down at upper (broad curved lobe), extends short right at upper.
  Structural detail:
    - E2: mostly straight edges
    - E1: highly curved
    - E3: highly curved
    - E4: highly curved

SYMMETRY: vertical (score 1.00)
  Pairs: (E3↔E4)

CONTAINMENT TREE:
  E2 [LARGE] circular at center (3 children)
    E1 [MEDIUM] triangular at center
    E3 [SMALL] circular at center
    E4 [SMALL] circular at right

LEARNED PATTERNS:
  1. Low fill percentage with many elements means stroke-based or outline-only rendering. The shapes exist as boundaries, not as filled regions. The visual result may appear solid to a viewer but the SVG construction uses outlines. Don't confuse SVG rendering technique with visual appearance.
  2. High bilateral symmetry with few elements indicates intentional geometric construction — likely a designed symbol, icon, or simple illustration. The symmetry axis and paired elements define the compositional structure directly.
  3. Concentric groups (elements sharing a center) are multi-ring constructions — a detail feature built from layered shapes. Their position relative to the largest containing element and their size tier determine their structural role.
