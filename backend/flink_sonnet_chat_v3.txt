# This SVG depicts a **flamingo** (or similar long-necked wading bird)

## Evidence from the spatial data:

### **PRIMARY BOUNDARY (Most Critical)**
The PRIMARY BOUNDARY Braille grid shows the actual subject outline, and it reveals:
- A **distinctive curved S-shaped form** with a long slender neck extending upward from a rounded body
- The outline shows a thick body mass at bottom-center, narrowing to a long curved extension at top-left
- Clear bird-like proportions: compact body with elongated curved neck

### **Skeleton Topology (Confirms Bird Structure)**
- **Main lower-left axis (27px)** — the primary body/torso
- **15 branches radiating from the core**, including:
  - **Long upper-left branch (21px)** — the extended curved neck
  - **Lower-right branches (19px, 16px, 13px)** — likely legs/feet
  - **Short upper-right branch (6px)** — possibly head/beak
- **15 junctions, 4 endpoints** — complex organic branching typical of bird anatomy

### **Radial Profile (Shape Fingerprint)**
The distance measurements from center show:
- **Peak at 30° (30px, upper-right)** — head/neck extension reaching outward
- **Peak at 165° (28px, left)** — body mass extends leftward
- **Peak at 315° (26px, lower-right)** — legs/lower body
- **Valley at 0° (11px, right)** — concave curve where neck meets body
- This asymmetric profile with one major extension is characteristic of a long-necked bird in profile

### **Simplified Outline Trace**
Starting bottom-center: "extends short right → descends down → extends short right → rises long upper-right → rises short upper-left → descends short lower-left → extends long left → descends long down"

This describes a bird standing upright with its neck curved backward in the classic flamingo S-curve pose.

### **Supporting Details**
- **Orientation**: The mass distribution and focal elements position this as an upright bird facing left
- **Composition**: "Asymmetric" with "moderate vertical symmetry (0.57)" — appropriate for a bird in natural standing pose
- **Aspect ratio 1.7** (wider than tall in the canvas, but the bird itself extends vertically)

**Conclusion**: This is a stylized illustration of a flamingo or similar wading bird, characterized by its iconic long curved neck, compact body, and standing posture.
