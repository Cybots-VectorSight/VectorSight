# SVG Analysis

Based on the spatial enrichment data, this SVG depicts a **stylized bird**, specifically what appears to be a **parrot or cockatoo** in profile, facing left.

## Key Identifying Features:

### Silhouette Shape
- **Primary boundary outline**: The simplified 8-vertex outline shows a bird form with distinct head region (upper-left), body mass (center), and tail region (lower-right)
- **Orientation**: Diagonal principal axis at 43° indicates the bird is positioned at an angle, characteristic of a perched bird pose
- **Proportions**: Roughly square (aspect 0.99) with moderate eccentricity (0.16), typical of compact bird silhouettes

### Radial Profile Peaks (Key Protrusions)
1. **30° peak (30px) - upper-right**: Likely the **crest or head plumage** — the most prominent feature
2. **165° peak (28px) - left**: Probably the **beak projection**
3. **315° peak (26px) - lower-right**: The **tail feathers**

### Structural Details
- **Skeleton structure**: Main axis of 27px with 15 branches — indicating the body, with smaller branches for head features (beak, crest) and wing/tail details
- **Concentric groups at right side** (x=89%): Positioned where a bird's **eye** would be located
- **High-circularity element (E55)** at position (229,147): Circular element (circ=1.00) strongly suggests the **eye**
- **Mass distribution**: Centrally weighted with vertical balance — consistent with a bird body

### Color Palette
The gradient colors (#E65270 reds, #8B4FBA purples, #FAA100 oranges) suggest this is a **tropical or exotic bird**, rendered in vibrant, stylized colors rather than naturalistic tones — characteristic of logo or brand illustration style.

**Conclusion**: This is a decorative/stylized **bird illustration** (likely a parrot or cockatoo) shown in left-facing profile, with distinctive head crest, visible eye, and tail plumage rendered in gradient colors.
